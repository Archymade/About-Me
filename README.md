## ðŸš€ About Me

### Hi there and welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹ !

I am Benedict Emoekabu, an aspiring Data Scientist based in Benin-City, Nigeria. I have been into data science and artificial intelligence for three years now, and I have been loving every second of it. I am a highly motivated individual who always loves to learn new technologies and solve new problems. I like to build machine learning and deep learning models, with the hope of adding some value, however minute, to the field of AI. I am experienced in: 

+ Python
+ R 
+ Data Cleaning 
+ Data Visualization 
+ Machine Learning
+ Deep learning
+ SQL
+ PyTorch

My numerous hobbies include: artificial intelligence (of course!), reading, music, strolling and gaming. I believe that there is always more to learn, and that there is always room for improvement. As such, there will always be a need to learn new skills and sharpen old ones.
